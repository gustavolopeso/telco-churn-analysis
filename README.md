## How can data analytics help us understand and prevent churn?

In this project I used the churn dataset of the fictitious Telco company provided by IBM to learn more about business metrics and present an analysis about churn, establishing hypotheses and proposing measures to reduce the company's churn rate.

Finally, a classifier was also created to predict the probability of churn for a given customer, in order to guide actions to avoid it.

The analysis and the code are inside the available .ipynb file. Hope you enjoy it!
